Overview\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## **1.1 Context**\n\nThis dataset contains information on heart attack cases in Japan, capturing various patient attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. Analyzing these factors can provide insights into key contributors to heart attacks and help identify high-risk groups.\n\n## 1.2 Task\n\nUsing the dataset, this post aims to utilize appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and `ggplot2` functions to:\n\n-   Examine the distribution of heart attack occurrences based on patient demographics and medical history, and\n\n-   Investigate the relationships between heart attack incidence and factors such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health parameters.\n\n# 2. Getting Started\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.1 Load packages\n\nThe following R packages will be loaded using the `p_load()` function for the analysis.\n\n-   **tidyverse**: Core collection of R packages designed for data science.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **moments**: Statistical package for calculating moments such as skewness and kurtosis.\n\n-   **ggrepel**: Provides geoms for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text labels, making plots more readable.\n\n-   **ggthemes**: Provides additional themes for **ggplot2**, enhancing plot aesthetics.\n\n-   **patchwork**: A package for combining multiple **ggplot2** plots into a single layout, enabling the creation of complex and multi-panel visualizations.\n\n-   **dplyr**: A package for data manipulation, providing easy-to-use functions for transforming, summarizing, and filtering data.\n\n-   **ggstatsplot**: An extension of **ggplot2** that provides easy-to-use functions for visualizing statistical results, including p-values and confidence intervals.\n\n-   **ggalluvial**: A **ggplot2** extension for creating alluvial diagrams, useful for visualizing categorical data flows and relationships across multiple variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, moments, ggrepel, ggthemes,\n               patchwork, dplyr, ggstatsplot, ggalluvial)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2.2 Import data\n\nThe dataset (`japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv`) used in this exercise is sourced from the Kaggle project titled **\"Heart Attack in Japan (Youth vs Adult)\"** by Ashay Choudhary. This dataset provides information on heart attack cases in Japan, focusing on both youth and adult populations, and includes various health-related attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.\n\nThe dataset will be imported as jha.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njha <- read_csv(\"data/japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2.2 Data pre-processing\n\nIn this section, we will be focusing on the pre-proccessing of the data that we will be using for the analysis.\n\n### 2.2.1 Glimpse of Data\n\nUsing the `glimpse` function, we can see that dataset contains 30,000 observations (rows) across 32 variables (columns). Each observation corresponds to a patient case from the heart attack dataset in Japan, and the variables provide information on various health indicators. The column names, column type, and the first few entries of each column can be observed below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(jha)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 32\n$ Age                     <dbl> 56, 69, 46, 32, 60, 25, 78, 38, 56, 75, 36, 40…\n$ Gender                  <chr> \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"F…\n$ Region                  <chr> \"Urban\", \"Urban\", \"Rural\", \"Urban\", \"Rural\", \"…\n$ Smoking_History         <chr> \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Y…\n$ Diabetes_History        <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No…\n$ Hypertension_History    <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No…\n$ Cholesterol_Level       <dbl> 186.4002, 185.1367, 210.6966, 211.1655, 223.81…\n$ Physical_Activity       <chr> \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", …\n$ Diet_Quality            <chr> \"Poor\", \"Good\", \"Average\", \"Good\", \"Good\", \"Go…\n$ Alcohol_Consumption     <chr> \"Low\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", \"High\", \"Hig…\n$ Stress_Levels           <dbl> 3.644786, 3.384056, 3.810911, 6.014878, 6.8068…\n$ BMI                     <dbl> 33.96135, 28.24287, 27.60121, 23.71729, 19.771…\n$ Heart_Rate              <dbl> 72.30153, 57.45764, 64.65870, 55.13147, 76.667…\n$ Systolic_BP             <dbl> 123.90209, 129.89331, 145.65490, 131.78522, 10…\n$ Diastolic_BP            <dbl> 85.68281, 73.52426, 71.99481, 68.21133, 92.902…\n$ Family_History          <chr> \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No…\n$ Heart_Attack_Occurrence <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\"…\n$ Extra_Column_1          <dbl> 0.40498852, 0.03627815, 0.85297888, 0.39085280…\n$ Extra_Column_2          <dbl> 0.43330004, 0.51256694, 0.21959083, 0.29684675…\n$ Extra_Column_3          <dbl> 0.62871236, 0.66839275, 0.61343656, 0.15572404…\n$ Extra_Column_4          <dbl> 0.70160955, 0.11552874, 0.50800995, 0.87025144…\n$ Extra_Column_5          <dbl> 0.49814235, 0.42381938, 0.90066981, 0.39035591…\n$ Extra_Column_6          <dbl> 0.007901312, 0.083932768, 0.227205241, 0.40318…\n$ Extra_Column_7          <dbl> 0.79458257, 0.68895108, 0.49634358, 0.74140891…\n$ Extra_Column_8          <dbl> 0.29077922, 0.83016364, 0.75210679, 0.22396813…\n$ Extra_Column_9          <dbl> 0.49719307, 0.63449028, 0.18150125, 0.32931387…\n$ Extra_Column_10         <dbl> 0.52199452, 0.30204337, 0.62918031, 0.14319054…\n$ Extra_Column_11         <dbl> 0.79965663, 0.04368285, 0.01827617, 0.90778075…\n$ Extra_Column_12         <dbl> 0.72239788, 0.45166789, 0.06322702, 0.54232201…\n$ Extra_Column_13         <dbl> 0.1487387, 0.8786714, 0.1465122, 0.9224606, 0.…\n$ Extra_Column_14         <dbl> 0.8340099, 0.5356022, 0.9972962, 0.6262165, 0.…\n$ Extra_Column_15         <dbl> 0.061632229, 0.617825340, 0.974455410, 0.22860…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Removing columns with no description\n\nDue to a lack of information on the additional columns, we will filter out the extra columns in our dataset as part of the pre-processing.

percentage of indivuals that experience heart attack coming from **urban regions** regardless of gender.\n\n-   **Moderate physical activity** is common among those with heart attacks.\n\n-   **Good and Average** **diet** appears to be linked to a higher occurrence of heart attacks.\n\n-   **Moderate and low alcohol consumption** shows the most notable presence in the heart attack group.\n\n-   **General Insight**: Although the plot emphasizes the impact of **lifestyle factors** like **physical activity**, **diet**, and **alcohol consumption** on heart attack occurrence, it simply depicts the observations of these factors in the group of people with heart attack occurrence.\n\n-   **Further Investigation:** Upon further comparison with the group with no heart attack occurrence, it seems to exhibit a similar pattern to the group with hear attack occurrence. **Statistical studies** have to be performed to confirm if the pattern is more significant in one group than the other.\n:::\n\n### 3.1.5 Exploring impact of risk factors on Heart Attack Occurence\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create binary risk factor columns (TRUE if risk factor present, FALSE

relatively stable (around 9.9%) for individuals with **1 to 3 risk factors**, indicating that a few risk factors don’t dramatically increase heart attack occurrence.\n-   With **4 to 5 risk factors**, the heart attack occurrence percentage rises slightly to 10.0% and 10.6%, showing a modest increase in risk.\n-   At **6 risk factors**, the heart attack occurrence drops sharply to 0%, likely due to a very small sample size (only 49 individuals), suggesting unreliable data for this group.\n-   Larger sample sizes at 1 to 3 risk factors ensure more reliable results, while smaller sample sizes at higher risk levels lead to potential inconsistencies.\n-   The overall trend indicates that heart attack risk **increases slightly with the accumulation of risk factors** up to 5.\n:::\n\n### 3.1.6 Summary\n\n#### 3.1.6.1 Conclusion\n\n-   Age and Heart Attack: Adult and Middle-Age patients tend to have higher heart attack occurrences, but the weak association with age suggests that further analysis is needed to better understand its impact.\n-   Heart Rate and Risk: Patients with heart attacks show slightly higher heart rates, especially in older age groups. While there is a trend, more analysis is required to confirm its significance.\n-   Risk Factors: Smoking is the most consistent risk factor across age groups, while family history increases risk in older individuals. Risk factors appear to act independently.\n-   Lifestyle Factors: Physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption are linked to heart attack occurrence, but similar patterns are seen in both heart attack and non-heart attack groups.\n-   Accumulated Risk: Heart attack occurrence increases slightly with the accumulation of 1 to 5 risk factors. However, due to small sample sizes at higher risk levels, further modeling and collection of data for risk levels 6 and above are required for more reliable insights.\n\n#### 3.1.6.2 Future Work\n\nWhile the visualizations provide useful observations, further statistical analyses and modeling techniques (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) are essential to better explain the true impact of individual and combined variables on heart attack occurrence. These models can help quantify the relative contribution of each variable, determine interactions between risk factors and potentially identify new insights that can inform preventive measures and interventions for heart attacks.\n\n# References\n\n-   Prof Kam Tin Seong (2025) https://r4va.netlify.app/.
